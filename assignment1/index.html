    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am Uzama Enoma Blessed, a passionate and driven aspiring frontend <br />
      developer with a strong interest in building interactive and user-friendly <br />
      web applications. Currently, I am in my final year studying Computer <br />
      Science in Benin Republic, where I have been honing my problem-solving <br />
      skills and deepening my understanding of technology. My journey into <br />
      frontend development stems from my love for creating visually appealing <br />
      and functional web solutions. While I have always been fascinated by <br />
      technology, I did not have a strong background in frontend development. <br />
      However, my eagerness to learn and grow led me to discover AltSchool <br />
      Africa's Frontend Development program.
    </p>
    <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool’s Frontend Development program because I saw it as an <br />
      incredible opportunity to gain industry-relevant skills, practical <br />
      experience, and mentorship from seasoned professionals. Without the fully <br />
      funded scholarship I received, I wouldn’t have been able to afford the <br />
      program, making this opportunity even more meaningful. I am truly grateful <br />
      for this chance to accelerate my learning and move closer to my goal of <br />
      becoming a skilled frontend developer.
    </p>
    <h2>My Goals for the Program</h2>
    <p>
      Through this program, I aim to master core frontend technologies like <br />
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React while building <br />
      real-world projects that enhance my problem-solving skills. I want to gain <br />
      hands-on experience in developing responsive and user-friendly web <br />
      applications, following best practices for debugging, optimization, and <br />
      performance improvement. Additionally, I look forward to networking with <br />
      like-minded individuals, learning from experienced mentors, and connecting <br />
      with industry experts to expand my professional circle. Ultimately, my <br />
      goal is to leverage the knowledge and experience gained from this program <br />
      to secure a junior frontend developer role, particularly in industries <br />
      like e-commerce and educational technology.
